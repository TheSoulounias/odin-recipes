    <h1>Fylla</h1>
    <img src="../images/fylla.jpg">
    <p>Fylla or phylla, meaning leaves in Greek, is the Kalymnian take on the Greek dolmades or Turkish dolmas, which are a type of stuffed vine-leaf rolls. The filling usually consists of a combination of ground beef and pork, rice, onions, tomatoes, salt, and pepper, but some versions are made without meat.</p>
    <p>Once stuffed, the rolls are typically arranged in a large pot over a layer of vine leaves and tomato slices, covered with water or stock and lemon juice, then cooked until tender and fragrant. This traditional dish is usually enjoyed with a dollop of Greek yogurt on top, and it is often prepared on Sundays.</p>
