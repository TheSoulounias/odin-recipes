    <p><b>Instructions</b></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven: preheat the oven to 180°C / 350-375°F / Gas Mark 4-5.
        </li>
        <li>Dry rub: combine the garlic powder, onion powder, mustard powder,
             cayenne pepper, paprika, salt and pepper in a small glass and use a
             mini whisk to combine.
            </li>
        <li>Barbecue sauce: combine the bbq sauce, tomato sauce, Worcestershire
            sauce and honey in a jug and use a mini whisk to combine.
        </li>
        <li>Chicken ribs: pat the chicken ribs dry using paper towel and a chopping
             board. Then transfer them to a medium bowl.
            </li>
        <li>Rub onto ribs: sprinkle half of the dry rub over the ribs and then use
             kitchen tongs to toss and combine. Then sprinkle in the other half and
             again toss to combine.
            </li>
        <li>Baking dish: spray a baking dish with olive oil. Then add the seasoned
             ribs to the dish in one flat later. Cover with foil and place in to
             the oven on the middle shelf. Allow to cook for 15 minutes, then use
             kitchen tongs to remove, place on a heat proof surface, pull the foil
             off and use tongs to rotate the ribs to the other side. Place the foil
             back on and then place the ribs back into the oven for another
             15 minutes.
            </li>
        <li>Grill/broil: use oven mits to remove the cooked ribs from the oven and
             place on a heat proof surface. Change the oven setting to grill at
              200°C 392°F6. Use kitchen tongs to transfer each rib to a silicon
               baking mat on an oven rack and tray. Use the pastry brush to re coat
                each rib with the homemade bbq sauce. Place the tray into the oven
                 on the top shelf. Grill the ribs for 10 mins. Repeat basting and
                  grilling x 1. (Total grill time is 2 x 10 mins = 20 minutes).
                </li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy: use oven mits to remove the baking tray from the oven
             and place on a heat proof surface. Let the ribs rest for 1 to 2 minutes
              before using tongs to transfer them to a serving plate. Provide
               horseradish yogurt sauce (optional) for serving.
